We put the three models trained on different datasets into three different 
folders.In each folder, the 'source' folder contains models trained in the
source model training phase, while the 'adapt_ours' folder contains models 
trained in the target model adaptation phase.The effectiveness of our models 
can be tested using the code in test_acc.py.
